# nand2tetris
"From nand to tetris" is the coloquial name for the learning program laid out in [Elements of Computing Systems]
(http://www.nand2tetris.org/) which guides you in the full construction of a virtual computing platform. The projects
started with using a hardware design language to simulate a CPU, then I designed and wrote an assembler and stack 
based virtual machine compiler in Haskell to execute a high level OO style language on this platform. It was a 
pretty cool way to learn about computer archetecture and compilers, as well as play around in Haskell.
